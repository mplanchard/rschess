WIP: Rust chess engine

This is an explicitly-for-my-own-learning-and-enjoyment side project to
write a chess engine in Rust.

## Why

I've wanted to write a chess engine for some time. Much of my recent
hobby programming has been in Rust, and I've come to really enjoy the
language. Given the clear benefits of performance for a chess engine,
it seems like a good fit regardless, so Rust it is.
